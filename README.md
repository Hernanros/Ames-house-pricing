# Ames-house-pricing
my journey to top 10% leaderboard on a kaggle competition for beginners.

This competition was mt first full length python project I carried out from end to end.
my main goals on this project were:
1. to preform exploratory data analysis,to contemplate on the different variables and find meaningful insight from exploring them
2. to practice feature selection and variable editing using pandas
3. to build and improve ML models based on existing API's

after I had a working model, I started improving by implamenting basic stacking and enssamble methods i saw people use in other projects.
my best submission got me to the 303th palce out of 4461 enteries (at the time) - 94th percentile
